# This head node was intentionally chosen to be larger than 2GPUs (has 4GPUs).
# This makes sure we can safely migrate the 2GPU testcases to GCE without having
# 2GPU instances available on GCE today.
# TODO (Artur): Move to 2GPU head node once it's available or possibly make tests using this use 4 GPUs.
# Note: Remember to also update the worker counts in this file when doing this!
